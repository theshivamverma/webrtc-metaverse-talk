# WebRTC Metaverse Talk Code Examples

- To make this code work. Add a variable in your .env file ```REACT_APP_HMS_AUTH_TOKEN```
- The value of this variable can be taken from [100ms](https://www.100ms.live/) Dashboard after creating a account.
- Hardcoding auth token is not advisory, It was done for just the talk. 
- Follow 100ms docs to set up the server side for generating Auth tokens
